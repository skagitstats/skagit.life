# Washington State

[Jake Low built this](https://observablehq.com/@jake-low/covid-19-in-washington-state){target="_blank"} visual with county level data. 

I tweaked his code to change up the colors^[I'm sick of red.] and plugged in [ data curated by the new york times](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data)^[The numbers are little different than reported from Skagit public health. Counting is hard.], which looks like they collect from the [Washington State Department of Health](https://www.doh.wa.gov/emergencies/coronavirus){target="_blank"}. 


The heatmap shows cases per capita, which is also included in the table below.
