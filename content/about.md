This is the about page. Clearly, I should tell you what this site is 'about'^[That's for darn sure.]. 

[Websters dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/about?src=search-dict-hed) defines 'about' as: 

> about, adverb: reasonably close to 

which honestly I thought would be more helpful--but now I'm kind of flustered and want to bail on this whole idea of mine to 'have a blog' where I 'record my thoughts' about 'things I am interested in'^[data, R, being a human, music, this list is now causing me anxiety] and 'try to impress' any unfortunate soul who happens to click on something that causes their computer to arrange their precious screen pixels to show this horribly long sentence^[yikes]. 

In summary, this site is a place where I explain to nobody the thoughts that emerge from my brains ever so slight vibrations. Also I live in Skagit Valley, which explains the name.
