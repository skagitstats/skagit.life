<p><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/about?src=search-dict-hed">Websters dictionary</a> defines “about” as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>about, adverb: reasonably close to</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which I thought<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> would be more relevant tbh.</p>
<p>I’m not so sure about this whole new trend to “do a blog” about “things” I am “interested” in <a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> to “try to impress” the imagined beings who may click on something that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_mood">commands</a> their computer to render this<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>. It seems <em>presumptuious</em> and <em>rude</em>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this is a place where patterns are stored on a server due to the vibrations of my brain <a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_(book)">It will soon become extremely popular</a>, since I plan to model it after McBeth’s characterization of life itself <a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Plus I live in the Skagit Valley, which explains the rest.</p>
