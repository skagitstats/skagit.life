# Tell all the truth but tell it slant — (1263)

### BY EMILY DICKINSON

>Tell all the truth but tell it slant — <br>
>Success in Circuit lies <br>
>Too bright for our infirm Delight <br>
>The Truth's superb surprise <br>
>As Lightning to the Children eased <br>
>With explanation kind <br>
>The Truth must dazzle gradually <br>
>Or every man be blind — <br>

#blessing the boats
###BY LUCILLE CLIFTON

>(at St. Mary's)
>
>may the tide <br>
>that is entering even now  <br>
>the lip of our understanding  <br>
>carry you out  <br>
>beyond the face of fear  <br>
>may you kiss  <br>
>the wind then turn from it  <br>
>certain that it will  <br>
>love your back &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     may you  <br>
>open your eyes to water  <br>
>water waving forever  <br>
>and may you in your innocence  <br>
>sail through this to that  <br>
