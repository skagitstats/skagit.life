      <description>Websters dictionary defines “about” as:
 about, adverb: reasonably close to
 which I thought1 would be more relevant tbh.
I’m not so sure about this whole new trend to “do a blog” about “things” I am “interested” in 2 to “try to impress” the imagined beings who may click on something that commands their computer to render this3. It seems presumptuious and rude.

I live in the Skagit Valley, which explains the domain name.
  adding to this list is now causing me anxiety &amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;

      <description>Total daily counts of covid-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths reported by Skagit Public Health.
     Cases include total confirmed and presumptive positives, which means that a private lab reported a positive test.
 Hospitalized are people with positive tests who were hospitalized at any point during their illness.
  The first case in Skagit Valley was reported on March 10, 2020.</description>
